Agent-Based Modelling in Finance Coursework

This project was created as a team of 5 students based on the 7CCSMAMF Agent-Based Modelling in Finance module requirements for the MSc Computational Finance course at King’s College London. These were the following:

Task: Your task is to design and create an agent-based model for some domain, and run simulations through this model.

Purpose: The aim of this project is to gain some practical experience in designing and creating an agent-based model (ABM).

Technology: You may use any technology you wish for the project. For example, you may do any of the following:
(a) Use an open-source publicly-available agent-based modelling platform such as NETLOGO https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ or JASA (Java
Auction Simulator API, developed by Dr Steve Phelps) http://jasa.sourceforge.net/.
(b) Use a commercial platform, such as SIMUDYNE https://www.simudyne.
com/technology/agent-based-modeling/.
(c) Write your own ABM using a language such as C.
SIMUDYNE and JASA both require some knowledge of Java programming language. If no-one in your team knows Java, and you don’t wish to learn it quickly, then we recommend using NETLOGO.

Application Domain:
The application domain of our agent-based model (ABM) is environmental sustainability. By the utilisation of a variety of agents representing some of the most polluting sources on planet Earth, our ABM can simulate different scenarios and interventions to inform decision-making for a more responsible future.

Since humans, deforestation and companies were responsible for 7%, 20% and 24% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, respectively, we decided to implement these three agents in our model, named Humans, Trees and Companies. Each possesses numerous attributes which all affect their own and each other’s net carbon emissions. In combination, a realistic ecosystem was formed which allows for the analysis and simulation of the carbon footprint of human activities (portrayed by human habits and company operations) and deforestation/reforestation.

There are multiple factors which can be investigated by interacting with the experiment, whilst looking at environmental sustainability. These can be the impact of various human behaviours; both psychological (such as influence and incentives) and physical, as well as the effects of policies or international actions on climate change and carbon emissions. For example, different enterprise taxes based on carbon output, incentives for the employment of renewable energy sources or rewards for reforestation efforts.
